# Games of Chance
A Python project on Codecademy that I tried making more interactive than the brief requested

Originally, the brief needed 4 games:
- heads or tails
- cho han (guessing whether the sum of two dice will be odd or even)
- card-off (not sure if this has a real name - just two players picking a card each; the higher card wins)
- roulette (only including rules regarding numbers, red/black and odd/even)

The games needed to be defined in a function each; returning the amount won/lost in the game.

I've created the games just as the original brief requested, but was frustrated that I couldn't show the work off to my partner, as printing in all your bets and guesses in one go is just not fun. I then came up with the idea of using input, which I had just learned in a different Python course, and making the games obviously still text-based, but able to recreate the heat-of-the-moment decisions that you would make in the real games, based on your good or bad luck in the games.
